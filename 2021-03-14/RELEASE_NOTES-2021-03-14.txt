Notes for release 2021-03-14
============================

This release adds new palmprints from the Serratus project:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241729v2

Canonical ranks
---------------
These are ranks phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.

named.fa
--------
New FASTA file with taxonomy at canonical ranks according to
the NCBI Taxonomy Identifier provided by the source databases.

serratus.fa
-----------
Unlike other sources such as GenBank and Uniprot, Serratus does
not provide NCBI Taxonomy Identifiers. These palmprints are
therefore handled as a special case.

The serratus.fa file contains Serratus palmprint sequences
which were not present in the previous PALMdb release (2021-03-02).
These palmprints are annotated with predicted taxonomy at
canonical ranks. Prediction was made by aligning serratus.fa
to named.fa and taking a consensus of the top 10 hits by reporting
the majority name, or "." if there was no majority. Only hits
above an identity threshold for each rank are considered: 90% for
species, 75% for genus and 40% for higher ranks.
